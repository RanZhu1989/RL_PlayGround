# Reinforcement Learning Playground for Beginners

--------------------------------------------------
This repository is still under construction. Till now, the following algorithms are included:
- [x] Classical Value-based Algorithms: [Sarsa], [Q-Learning]
- [x] Value Function Approximation Algorithms: [Naive Q-Learning with neural network (Naive Q_nn)], [Naive Q_nn with replay buffer],[Vanilla DQN]
- [x] Classical Policy-based Algorithms: [REINFORCE]

In the future, I will add more algorithms, such as policy-based algorithms, actor-critic algorithms, offline RL algorithms and serval applications of RL in power distribution systems.

## 1. Introduction
This repository is a playground for beginners to learn reinforcement learning. It is a collection of simple environments and agents to get you started with reinforcement learning. Each algorithm is implemented in a single ipynb file with less than 500 lines of code, which written in pytorch and based on the latest gymnasium. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and clear implementation for each algorithm.

If you have already known basic concepts and mathematical notations of reinforcement learning but have no idea how to implement them, this repository is for you. If you are a beginner of reinforcement learning, I recommend you to learn the basic concepts and mathematical notations first. 

## 2. Requirements
All the codes are tested on the following environment:
- python == 3.8
- pytorch == 2.0
- gymnasium == 0.28
- numpy == 1.24
- matplotlib == 3.2
- pandas == 2.0

## 3. Thanks
I would like to thank Dr.Zhao for his unselfish sharing of the course materials (https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sd4y167NS/)
